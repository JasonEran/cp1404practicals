# Practicals Repository

Welcome to my `practicals` repository! This repository contains my solutions and projects completed as part of the CP1404 subject at James Cook University. It’s a collection of practical exercises designed to improve my programming skills, with a focus on Python and clean code principles.

## About Me

I’m [Qi Junyi], a student studying IT at James Cook University. I enjoy coding, solving problems, and learning how to write better software. This repository reflects my progress in mastering Python, project management, and software development practices under the guidance of my instructors.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

Throughout this subject, I’ve learned several key lessons about writing "clean code" that is readable, maintainable, and efficient. Here are three of the most important ones:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each function should do one thing well. For example, splitting `load_projects` into smaller functions like `parse_project_line` made my code easier to debug and understand.
- **Meaningful Naming**: Using descriptive names like `project` instead of `p` or `incomplete_projects` instead of `incomplete` clarifies what variables represent, reducing confusion.
- **Consistency with Constants**: Defining values like `DATE_FORMAT` and `FILE_HEADER` as constants at the top of my file ensures uniformity and simplifies future changes.

## Useful Resources

Here are some resources that have guided my work in this repository:

- [Programming Patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns) - A helpful guide for common coding patterns used in this subject.
- [CP1404 Practicals Instructions](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals) - The official instructions for these practical exercises.
- [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) - The official guide I used to format this README correctly.
