Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

100%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I usually watch videos at home in the morning. Most of the time is on weekdays. I also watch some videos in the morning when I'm not busy on weekends.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

It is worth adhering to a serious attitude towards homework and ensuring that one completes it to the best of their ability.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

What needs to be changed is the habit of writing comments. Try to write perfect and specific comments at once, rather than modifying them multiple times.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

What I didn't do well was my level of focus during practice. I should have been more focused and able to solve problems quickly.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Well done is the function writing, which basically does not cause SRP problems when first written.
