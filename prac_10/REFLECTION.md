# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

I personally think that the accuracy of the estimation is over 80%, but my accuracy is relatively low in some special topics, such as completing a complete menu program.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

My estimation accuracy is getting higher and higher, especially after going through many estimations, the accuracy is very high in the end.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I have learned that reasonable time estimation can better arrange tasks, which means that I will spend less time to complete a task with higher efficiency and accuracy.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I have learned that my code is not perfect, everyone has their own opinions, and I have never thought of some constructive suggestions. This means that code review has broken through my personal limitations and has been very helpful in maintaining and improving the quality of my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

By reviewing other people's code, I can improve my programming skills and also learn from their programming ideas. Review is beneficial for both parties and can help me discover more efficient programming processes.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 08 Code Review](https://github.com/ShikunBai/CP1404-Practicals/pull/4#event-17138729950)

### Explanation

I think it's great that this student is missing a lot of function comments. I can remind him and give him an example, which can help him think and help him supplement the remaining comments.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 07 Code Review](https://github.com/ZhangGuoyang1/prac_07_feedback/pull/1#issuecomment-2764358975)

### Explanation

I have discovered areas in GuoYang's program that can be optimized. I gave him a suggestion to add an error checking feature to his program. This is great, it improves the maintainability of the code and enhances my personal programming skills.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of this subject, I would enhance students' sense of achievement when completing weekly assignments while maintaining the same level of teaching. In other words, I would make them see weekly assignments as a fun game to cultivate their interest in programming and improve their programming skills. At the same time, reducing the amount of homework that teachers correct makes it easier for them.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I think the best thing I did was falling in love with programming and learning, which helped me improve my programming efficiency. Developed an optimistic attitude of taking every program seriously.
